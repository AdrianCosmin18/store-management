# store-management
I created an app that presents concepts specific to OOP in C++ which includes : Encapsulation, 
Inheritance , Polymorphism, Overriding, Abstraction. The project is a vehicle rental application and 
in his final stage should have a choise, you can log in as a staff member (administrator) or existing
customer or you can create a new account as a customer. The application has a menu in which you
can find options such as: viewing the current list of products, add a product in cart, view the cart,
delete a product or to place an order.
